1. compile: make
2. run: ./pn infile [-ah]
   Here ModuleName is the string that we want to write to the 
   "NAME" section of the output gDPS file.
   If infile has suffix ".i", e.g. "ABC.i", the output file name replaces
   ".i" with ".o": "ABC.o"
   If infile suffix is not ".i", e.g., "ABC.txt", the output file name
   is the infile name with appendix ".o": "ABC.txt.o"
3. make a distribution: make dist
